        <h2>OAKTON PARADISE</h2>
        <p>Located in a beautiful Oakton neighborhood, this project is a true hidden gem. The project breathed new life into
          the existing screened-in porch with all new finishes, new appliances, and a pavilion attachment with a wood
          burning fireplace. The pool was built nearly 10 feet out of ground surrounded by a deck supported pool deck to
          connect everything at one level. The finished result completely transformed the way this family uses their
          property and boosted their lifestyle.</p>
